        <h1>Innovators</h1>

        <p>An interesting mix of <em>logicians</em>, <em>mathematicians</em>, and those familiar with
        the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_loom">Jacquard
          Loom</a></em>.</p>

        <h2>George Boole</h2>

        <img src="./images/boole.jpg" alt="Image of boole" />

        <p>English logician who invented a logic based around 1's and 0's, we
        call it "Boolean logic" in his honor.</p>

        <h2>Charles Babbage</h2>

        <img src="./images/babbage.jpg" alt="Image of babbage" />

        <p>English polymath who built the plans for the difference engine and
        the analytical engine: machines that would allow for symbolic and
        generalized computation.</p>

        <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>

        <img src="./images/ada.jpg" alt="Image of ada" />

        <p>English aristocrat who used her insight in seeing the pattern-based
        Jacquard Looms operate from a "plan" to build a similar "plan" for
        calculating Bernoulli numbers. Died lamentably young. Daughter of George
        Gordon, Lord Byron.</p>

        <a name="20th_century"></a>

        <h1>20<sup>th</sup> Century</h1>

        <p>Spurred by the World Wars and the Cold War, these individuals helped
        prepare our primitive cognitive apparatus to face the challenges of a
        world in which we swim in data.</p>

        <h2>Claude Shannon</h2>

        <img src="./images/shannon.jpg" alt="Image of shannon" />

        <p>Pioneer of information theory. Invented the term "bit" as
        abbreviation of "binary digit." Worked on numerous secret wartime
        activities. He loved jazz and played clarinet.</p>

        <h2>Alan Turing</h2>

        <img src="./images/turing.jpg" alt="Image of turing" />

        <p>What a legacy! Built a generalized machine to help break the Enigma
        cipher. Directly contributed to neutralizing the Nazi war machine in
        order to set the way for Allied victory. Later proposed generalized
        rules of all computers ("Turing Machines") and predicted the chief
        challenges in developing advanced artificial intelligence. After being
        pursued as a communist, was put on trial for his sexual identity,
        forced to take hormonal drugs as "chemical castration." This later
        drove him to suicide. Received posthumous apology from HRH Queen
        Elizabeth II. His life was cut short by three-quarters. What might he
        have given us with another half century to live?</p>

        <h2>Admiral Grace Hopper</h2>

        <img src="./images/hopper.jpg" alt="Image of hopper" />

        <p>Rear Admiral Hopper was a mathematician who was a programmer on one
        of the earliest computers at Harvard. Later she went on to help devise
        UNIVAC I, the first commercial computer. She also helped build COBOL,
        an early, English-like programming language that set the stage for
        languages like Python, Ruby, etc. She was also a formidable
        communicator of science and technology: she could find a way to
        communicate technological challenges in both mathematics as well as to
        laypeople, or military brass!</p>

      <section id="recent-era">
        <a name="recent"></a>
        <h1>Recent</h1>

        <p>While the 20th century saw us gain the ability to brute force
        process data into information, these individuals are leading the way to
        making working with the computer signify something within in the human
        mind.</p>

        <h2>Alan Kay</h2>

        <img src="./images/kay.jpg" alt="Image of kay" />

        <p>At heart, a biologist, Kay realized that the biological metaphor of
        "small units of intelligence, working together" was a better model for
        programming. This is the foundation of "Object-Oriented" programming!</p>

        <h2>Rich Hickey</h2>

        <img src="./images/hickey.jpg" alt="Image of hickey" />

        <p>Challenging the chief notion of Object-Orientation, that the world
        is full of states and things, Hickey advocates for the functional
        mindset in which programs are flows of processes interacting.</p>

        <h2>Matsumoto Yukihiro</h2>

        <img src="./images/matz.jpg" alt="Image of matz" />

        <p>A beloved programmer and gentle soul. "Matz" created his programming
        language, Ruby, to be a language that was fun for the programmer. It
        was designed to help channel joy to programmers. In some way, it
        recalls Marie Kondo's KonMari method of household maintenance. Both hinge on a
        notion of "joy."</p>
