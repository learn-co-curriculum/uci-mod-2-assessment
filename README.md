# UCI Extension Module 3 Entrance Exam

## Introduction

Welcome to this examination. It aims to assess your proficiency in two areas:

* Basic HTML site design
* Procedural programming in Ruby
* Unix / Git / Testing fundamentals

## Implementation

All work should be in this repository. When you are done, commit _all your
files_ to the repository and _push_ the repository to GitHub. The repository
should be public (and therefore free of charge). Provide the repository path to
UCI and we will run tests to verify your proficiency.

## Technical Requirements

You will need to have the `ruby` program and the `bundler` gem installed.

Upon cloning the repo to your local machine, run `bundle install` and ensure
that your application works.

## Proficiency 1: Basic HTML Site Design

Disaster has struck! Our web site was not under Git protection and, in a
recent hard drive failure, has been lost.

Fortunately our IT team has been able to cobble the files back together, but
they're broken. Return the web site to normal function.

Also, the team was able to recover a series of tests that make sure the basic
function of the site is working. As you're building out the site, be sure to
run: `rspec spec/build-site_spec.rb`. This will ensure that you meet the basic
requirements.

During development you can use `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000` in the repo
directory to run a local web server.  This should be sufficient to help you
visually verify the function of this website.

## Proficiency 2: Procedural Programming in Ruby
